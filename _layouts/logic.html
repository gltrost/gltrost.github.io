              <h2><a href="#">Logic /\ Formal Methods</a></h2>
              <img src="/images/turing.jpg" alt="Dead Tree 5 Îœinutes From Home" style="width: 500px; height: auto;">
              <p> (Mathematical) Logic is the study of formal reasoning via mathematical tools. 
              	  I usually like to think of Logic as the Mathematics of Mathematics. A major
              	  branch of Logic is Formal Methods (for Reasoning About Software and Hardware), which is a term that loosely describes various different approaches to try to, you guessed it, reason about software and hardware. For example, program-correctness or 
              	  program-termination.

							Most of my interests in Logic and Formal Methods revolve around 
							Data-Flow Analysis, Abstract Interpretation, Model Checking and Type Theory. I also currently work professionally in Formal Methods! Lucky me!! That said, this blog is not about my professional work. Things posted here are meant to be after-hours research. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm also curious to see where Formal Methods can be used in Computational
							Biology. Seeing as Computational Biology is by far dominated by Machine-
							Learning (Logic's arch nemesis), there are bound to be areas where 
							Formal Methods is overlooked in Computational Biology. Also, seeing how 
							the main drawback of Machine Learning is a lack of semantics, Logic is 
							sure to be of use.
